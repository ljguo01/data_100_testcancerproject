                <p>Both males and females have different incidence rates when it comes to cancers. However when it comes to gastrointestinal cancers, which include oesophagus, stomach, colorectum, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas cancers, gastrointestinal cancers have the greatest difference with 1,581,108 more men being diagnosed with the disease. This could be caused by the difference in specific causes of these cancers between the sexes. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Alcohol Usage Within the Past Month - 58% of males and 49% of females</li>
                    <li>Smoking - 13.1% of males and 10.1% of females</li>
                    <li>Obesity - 34.1% of males and 27% of females</li>

                <img src = 'img/Mortality.png' alt = 'Bar Chart' class = 'center'>
                <p>Although gastrointestinal cancers had the greatest overall mortality for both sexes, respiratory cancers was the greatest difference with 649,013 more men dying from the disease. This could be caused by the difference in smoking amounts between the sexes, a large factor to respiratory cancers, hormones that effect the rate of the cancer, and the treatment effectiveness between the sexes.</p>

                    <li>Smoking - 13.1% of males and 10.1% of females</li>
                    <li>Hormones - Testosterone (higher in males) leads to higher risk while estrogen (higher in females) has a protective agent against lung cancers</li>
                    <li>Treatments - Immuotherapies have a greater effectiveness for males while chemotherapies have a higher effectiveness for women</li>
