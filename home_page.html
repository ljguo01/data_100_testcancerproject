                <h2>Why Cancer?</h2>
                    <p>Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the US, as well as being one of the most commonly diagnosed diseases in the world. We wanted to focus on which cancer has the greatest effect on society, as well as why these results happened.</p>

                <h3>Topics to Cover</h3>
                    <p>Throughout our research we decided to find information about which cancer causes the greatest incidence and mortality rates, which cancer has the greatest difference in incidence and mortality rates by sex, where/why respitory cancer is so prevelant in countries around the world, and where/why cervical cancer is so prevelant in countries around the world. </p>
